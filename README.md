# weather-app
This is a web application that shows current weather information based on the user’s location or a searched city. It uses a public weather API to fetch real-time data like temperature, weather condition, humidity, and wind speed. It’s a beginner-friendly project to learn how to work with APIs and asynchronous JavaScript.
